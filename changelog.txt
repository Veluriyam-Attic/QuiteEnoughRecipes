Version {ModVersion}
- Items in the NPC shop tab now show buy prices and conditions in their tooltips.
- The item and NPC loot tabs now show drop chances and ranges of amounts that can be dropped.
- NPC loot has been adjusted to only show drops that would be shown in the current world's bestiary. For instance, bosses will not be shown to drop boss bags in a non-expert world.
